# JavaScript-A-Z-Notes 🎯

This is my attempt at sharing JS knowledge with everyone, even those who might not have the time to go through all the videos. Also, I will use this repo for quick reference to JS concepts when necessary. I made the mistake of writing notes on pen and paper while doing the Machine Learning course by AndrewNG and now its collecting 🕸️. Figured this would be a better way of documenting my journey 🔥
